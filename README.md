## Code explanation
#### Main Flow
At this moment, this app does not include the rendering of comments and the login feature. So it is still relatively simply. The entire flow of the app revolves around `MainActivity.java`. So the easiest way to understand the codebase is to start with `MainActivity.java`!

When you open up the app, you will see a scrollable list of images card, this is `MainActivity.java`. The ListView adapter used here is `ImageAdapter.java`.

There is a navigation drawer that you can open up by sliding from the left, or tapping on the burger menu button. The adapter code used in the navigation drawer can be found in `NavAdapter.java`.

When you click on any images, it will open up a detail view. In this detail view, you can view each posts in a more detail manner.

#### Dispatching work to other activities
Imgur posts come in various different formats, it can mainly be broken down into 3 categories:
 * normal image (.png .jpeg)
 * animated image (.gif .gifv .webm .mp4)
 * album (it contains a link to multiple images)
 
When the image is clicked, `ImgurLinkDispatcher.java` will determine which type of image it is, and launches the appropriate actvities as shown below:

* normal image is handled by `ImageViewerActivity.java`
* animated image is handled by `GifActivity.java`
* album is handled by `ImgurAlbumActivity.java`

#### Structure
* `app/` folder contains most of the source code
* `jimgur/` folder contains source code of the wrapper to Imgur API (https://api.imgur.com/)

## Known issues
* HD mode sometimes don't work on very long images
* Long images become blurry (because the ImageView fit by scaling to width)
* Long title get cut off in image cardview (need to show the full title in ImageViewerActivity and GifActivity
* Crash is reported for clicking on HD mode (need more info on this)
